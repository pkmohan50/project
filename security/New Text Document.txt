
Security Features:
In order to ensure security and also to ensure that only a genuine user is able to 
access the application, we intend to create a method whereby the user needs to identify himself by typing in his PNR number
and will need to generate a OTP which will be sent to the same mobile number that was used for booking the ticket.
Once he types in rhe OTP, he has access to all the features of the application.
